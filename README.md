Evolutionary Computation

I have thoroughly studied evolutionary computation and implemented several classic problems, 
including the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Genetic Programming (GP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), 
as well as the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP) and the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). 

Each project is accompanied by a corresponding report located in the "Reports" folder, which includes execution results, visualizations, and other relevant details.
